        <h2 id="intro">Intro duck shin</h2>
            <p>I see you're in the market for a college laptop. I did all the research and nerdy shit so you don't have to.</p>

        <h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>
            <h3>Stuff to keep in mind before you start shooopping:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What do you plan on doing with your computer?<br>
                    <p>Some activities like photo/video editing, 3D rendering and modeling, and pro Fortnite gaming are demanding tasks that may require heftier specifications compared to those of more casual users. The quality and capabilities of these tasks son muy importante para algunos, but may not be necessary for others.</p>
                    <p>If this isn't for you, that's cutesie patootsie and we don't needa worry ab that. You'll prob be fine using <em>integrated graphics</em> I'll explain that <a href="#gpu">here</a> if you care enough, but its cool if u don't :p</p></li>
                <li><strong>Performance: </strong> General speed, loading times, workload<br>
                    <p>So for all ur future college shii—homework (hopefully), streaming, general browsing, pro fortnite gaming, etc.—ur gonna want a pc that can run all these tasks quickly and efficiently, esp if you're the typa bitch to have 50 tabs, a music player, and a netflix show u told ur friends u would catch up on running in the background all at once. I'll also get into what to look for <a href="#ram">here</a>></p></li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Usage over the next four...or however many years of hell ur looking forward to<br>
                    <p>Ideally you prob want ur laptop to last for a few years, so get ur shii from reputable companies, review warranties, and get components that are either replaceable (like batteries and <a href="#storage">storage</a>) or built to last</p></li>
                <li><strong>Budget: </strong>For ur broke college student ass</li>
                    <p>You'll be inevitably broke and left with a bunch of student loans, so set a reasonable price range. Choose which features or components you can compromise to save a bit. Or treat yourself and splurge, u prob deserve it. But if you can't splurge, <strong>don't get a mac</strong>, the ones before 2021 suck frfr</p>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> You'll carry this bitch everywhere</li>
                    <p>A laptop under 5 lbs, or just under 10.5263 Mickey D's Big Macs (yes i did the math), is a decent and portable weight. The screen size makes a difference too, but that's entirely your preference. Having a long-lasting battery ensures that u don't have to carry around a bulky ass charger</p>
                <li><strong>Special Features: </strong>Stuff u may or may not need</li>
                    <h4>A quick little list of extra stuff u might want:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 in 1 — a laptop that can act like a tablet, for the artists and the iPad kids</li>
                            <li>touchscreen — a preference and convenience</li>
                            <li>biometrics — fingerprints, face id, and maybe a retina scanner to make things quick and secure</li>
                            <li>peripherals — mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, headphones and all that. may or may not need a 3.5mm jack for headphones and speakers, and make sure the laptop has enough usb type A or type C ports for the extra shii. if u have no idea what i just said, click <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-computer-ports">here</a></li>
                        </ul>
            </ul>
        
        <h2 id="pc-parts">PC Parts: the <em>real</em> nerdy shit</h2>
            <p>When you're looking at a laptop you wanna buy online, the <em>specifications</em> or <em>specs</em> section will give you all the info you need about the product. If you don't wanna get into the techy descriptions of each of the parts just skip the first paragraphs of each section (ಠ_ಠ)</p>
            
            <h3 id="cpu">Processor (CPU)</h3>
                <p>Think of it as the brain and heart of your computer. You might see the words <em>cores</em> and <em>threads</em> to describe the strength of the processor. In general for each of these, the more the better. More cores let you overload the computer with more tasks while more threads move information faster. This leads to higher <em>clock speeds</em>, which are also a good thing.</p>

                        <p class="footnote"><strong>Note: </strong> This table is a general rule of thumb, NOT a definitive hierarchy. One outlier is a certain i5-1300 series chip that's even more powerful than some i9's. And tbh the M2 chip is only slightly better than the M1 I just didn't wanna make more table rows</p>
                        <p>It's also worth paying attention to the <em>generation</em> of the CPU, which can be found as the first two numbers following the hyphen in Intel chips or the first number following the AMD identifier.</p>

                        <p>As usual, the higher the generation the better. I highly recommend gen 11 and above for Intel and gen 5 and above for AMD.</p>
            
            <h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
                <p>Now we need somewhere to store all of those Word Docs, PDFs, study guides, course syllabuses (syllabi?), music and streaming apps, unauthorized lecture recordings, minecraft worlds, and pro fortnite gaming clips that you'll accumulate over the next couple years. All this data is stored in a hard drive. In laptops today you'll prob only find the only storage option is an SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em>. The best hard drives offer the fastest <em>read and write speeds</em>, which are measures of how quickly data is accessed and saved (in Mb/s).</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>SSD Types</thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Level</th>

                        <td>Goated</td>
                        <td>NVMe with PCIe 4.0</td>

                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Long story short, look for NVMe and PCIe and everything will load and download quickly.</p>
                <p>You also should think about how much storage you actually need. I recommend at least 256 GB to last you through the next couple years. If you plan on getting a Mac, upgrading to 512 GB will actually make your storage even faster because of the dual-channels, which I don't feel like explaining. Remember that some laptops have storage u can upgrade later on while others don't.</p>

            <h3 id="ram">Memory (RAM)</h3>
                <p>MEMORY AND STORAGE ARE NOT THE SAME... so here's the difference: <em>random access memory</em>, or RAM is basically a much smaller and immensely quicker component that holds temporary data for easy access. RAM is the kitchen countertop where you assemble ur sandwich while storage is the fridge or pantry storing all the ingredients. The amount, type, and frequency of RAM are the important parts. The amount of memory lets u keep 300 tabs open in the background, and the type and frequency make all the data move faster.</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>RAM types</thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Level</th>
                        <th>Type</th>
                        <th>Speed Range (Mhz)</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Obsolete</td>
                        <td>DDR3 and under</td>
                        <td>slow asl</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Solid</td>
                        <td>DDR4</td>
                        <td>2133-3200</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Goated</td>
                        <td>DDR5</td>
                        <td>3200-6400</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>The amount of RAM you have lets you do a lot more all at once. 8 GB is a standard minimum, but 16 GB is the way to go if you're feelin' it now, mr krabs. Personally I think 32 GB is straight up unnecessary and anything more than that is overkill.</p>
            
            <h3 id="gpu">Graphics</h3>
                <p>If you have no idea what a graphics card is, don't worry, you prob don't need to, your <em>integrated graphics</em> will be just fine for ur college endeavors. But you fs won't be able to run Fortnite smoothly on your new laptop. If you aren't getting a Mac and want Fortnite to run a little more smoothly (or know you'll be doing something with 3D modeling, photo/video editing, or digital art), look for the words Nvidia RTX (or GTX on the lower end), or the words Radeon RX. These are <em>graphics processing units</em>, or GPUs. As usual, the higher the numbers that follow, the better...most of the time<br>
                    But if you are getting a Mac, the more cores the better. And you can prob run Fortnite on it at a decent graphics level and framerate.</p>

            <h3 id="summary">Quick Summary</h3>
                <p><strong>minimum specs: </strong>i5/Ryzen 5, 256 GB NVMe PCIe 3.0, 8 GB DDR4</p>
                <p>Higher numbers for pretty much everything are usually better but more expensive</p>
