        <h2 id="intro">Intro duck shin</h2>
            <p>I see you're in the market for a college laptop. I did all the research and nerdy shit so you don't have to.
            </p>

        <h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>
            <h3>Stuff to keep in mind before you start shooopping:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What do you plan on doing with your computer?<br>
                    <p>Some activities like photo/video editing, 3D rendering and modeling, and pro Fortnite gaming are demanding tasks that may require heftier specifications compared to those of more casual users. The quality and capabilities of these tasks son muy importante para algunos, but may not be necessary for others.</p>
                    <p>If this isn't for you, that's cutesie patootsie and we don't needa worry ab that. You'll prob be fine using <em>integrated graphics</em> I'll explain that <!-- link to gpu sections -->here if you care enough, but its cool if u don't :p</p></li>
                <li><strong>Performance: </strong> General speed, loading times, workload<br>
                    <p>So for all ur future college shii—homework (hopefully), streaming, general browsing, pro fortnite gaming, etc.—ur gonna want a pc that can run all these tasks quickly and efficiently, esp if you're the typa bitch to have 50 tabs, a music player, and a netflix show u told ur friends u would catch up on running in the background all at once. I'll also get into what to look for <!--linkt to pc parts sex shin, specifically cpu ram and storage-->here</p></li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Usage over the next four...or however many years of hell ur looking forward to<br>
                    <p>Ideally you prob want ur laptop to last for a few years, so get ur shii from reputable companies, review warranties, and get components that are either replaceable (like <!--more links here prob-->batteries and storage) or built to last</p></li>
                <li><strong>Budget: </strong>For ur broke college student ass</li>
                    <p>You'll be inevitably brokeand left with a bunch of student loans, so set a reasonable price range. Choose which features or components you can compromise to save a bit. Or treat yourself and splurge, u prob deserve it</p>
                <li><strong>Special Features: </strong>Stuff u may or may not need</li>
                    <h4>A quick little list of extra stuff u might want:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 in 1 — a laptop that can act like a tablet, for the artists and the iPad kids</li>
                            <li>touchscreen — a preference and convenience</li>
                            <li>biometrics — fingerprints, face id, and maybe a retina scanner to make things quick and secure</li>
                            <li>peripherals — mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, headphones and all that. may or may not need a 3.5mm jack for headphones and speakers, and make sure the laptop has enough usb type A or type C ports for the extra shii. if u have no idea what i just said, click <!--make clickable info about ports, usbm, 3.5mm, charging, maybe hdmi, ethernet, etc-->here</li>
                        </ul>
            </ul>
